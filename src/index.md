A few fun (but relevant) facts...

I learned how to program with [TI-BASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TI-BASIC) on
my childhood graphing calculator.

I enjoy writing C code as a hobby.

I generated this website with [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) and a [shell script](build.sh.txt) from [Markdown](src.tar.gz).
